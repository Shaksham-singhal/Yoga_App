# Yoga_App

## 1.1 About the project
Whether you want to build muscle, get a better night’s sleep, or have a healthier relationship with food, there’s an app for that. Actually, there are thousands of apps for that. 
You might think your smartphone is only for making calls, texting, or scrolling through social media. But this pocket-sized device is also an excellent tool for tracking, managing, and staying on top of your fitness goals. Fitness apps are specialized programs you can download on a phone, tablet, or other electronic devices. Some apps work great with the free version while others require shelling out a few dollars each month to access premium features. But they all aim to provide guidance, motivation, and accountability.  
We looked at fitness apps that offer a free version and a paid subscription or in-app purchase option. In general, the best fitness apps have a flexible subscription, come with multiple workout routines, and give you the ability to customize a program specific to your needs.

#2.	INTRODUCTION 
Applications for yoga can be divided into two types: applications that let users practice independently and applications that connect users with yoga instructors. Here are the features that you should implement in each of these applications. Of course, the cost to make an Yoga Daily-like app will depend on the set of features that you implement
